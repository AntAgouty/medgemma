            "    *   **Parenchyma:** No focal opacities suggestive of pneumonia, mass, or atelectasis are identified.\n",

            "    *   **Sternum:** There is clear evidence of **pectus excavatum**, characterized by a concave depression of the sternum. This is best appreciated in the lateral view (if available, but the PA view often shows the anterior displacement of the heart shadow).\n",
            "5.  **Soft Tissues:** The soft tissues of the chest wall appear normal, aside from the bony deformity mentioned above.\n",
